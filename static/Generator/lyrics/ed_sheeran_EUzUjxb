show every night in front of a new crowd\nThat\u2019s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now\nSee me lose focus as I sing to you loud\nI can\u2019t, no, I won\u2019t hush\nI\u2019ll say the words that make you blush\nI\u2019m gonna sing this now\nSee, I\u2019m true, my songs are where my heart is\nI'm like glue I stick to other artists\nI'm not you, now that would be disastrous\nLet me sing

a house plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow, from day one I've been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nNow I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause it's another day\nPlus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic\nAnd I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nSlipping into another rapper shoes using new laces\nI'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the moustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago\nBut more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me

jays old man\nCold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels\nPlus racists full of hatred in your own plant\n3 jobs in a day\nRest in life in you working but you were never stress free\nJust locked in a cage slaving\nThey said they were gold in the pavements\nBut you came and saw the road to amazement\nBroke your heart\nBut still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast\nI hope your listening right\nI still think of you every Sunday\nNo one can top your chicken and rice\nEven through the darkness times\nYou held us all up because your vision was bright\nI knew your strength was your wisdom

enough reason\nBefore I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing\nBut I guess that everyone's different\nOr should I say no one's perfect?\nShe had happiness in front of her\nBut chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing\nSince you gone the foundations crumbled\nSo building it back up is my next step\nI got all the bricks and the cement but\nIt's hard when it's done, I don't know what to

made it much worse calling police and\nShe'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused\nYou're causing scandal going mad in the ward now\nThe cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you\nThe same question he keeps trying to ask you, \"Who you working for?\"\nHe's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore\nYou're having a conversation you could be murdered for\nYou're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court\nIt's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before\nJust before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard\nHe underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card\nBegs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid\nCause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own\nYou've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe\nYou reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home\nBefore you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat\nAnd then a voice says, \"Where you been bitch? I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped\nAnd all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her 13th birthday\n\n[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd go mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\nCause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and\nSell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to

I love it\nI'll make your little secret public\nIt's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons\nYou sleep with in your closet to get back at me\nTrapped and I'm lacking sleep\nFact is you're mad at me\nBecause I backtrack so casually\nYou're practically my family\nIf we married then I'll guess you'd have to be\nBut tragically our love just lost the will to live\nBut would I kill to give it one more shot?\nI think not\n\n[Hook]\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't want you no\nAnymore\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't wanna love you no\nAnymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nRecently I tend to zone out\nUp in my headphones to Holocene\nYou promised your body but I'm away so much\nI stay more celibate than in a monastery\nI'm not cut out for life on the road\nCause I didn't know I'd miss you this much\nAnd at the time we'd just go, so sue me\nI guess I'm not the man that you need\nEver since you went to uni\nI've been sofa surfing with a rucksack\nFull of less cash and I guess that could get bad\nBut when I broke the industry\nThat's when I broke your heart\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\nBut good things are over fast\nI know it's hard to deal with and see this\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\nThen I turn the music off\nAnd all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\nI never really want to believe this\nGot advice from my dad and he\nTold me that family is all I'll ever have and need\nI guess I'm unaware of it\nSuccess is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd since you left, I've given up my days off\nIt's what I need to stay strong\nI know you have a day job but mine is 24/7\nI feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook\nCause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\nThe irony is if my career and music didn't exist\nIn 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid\nI'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\nAnd lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's\nJust hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill\nAnd I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\nCan I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing [Alice?]?\nIt's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me\nEventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be\nEither way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this\nThese things happen for a reason and you can't change shit\nTake my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty\nBut I had to get this off my chest\n\n[Hook]", "[Produced by Jake Gosling]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well\nAnd I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell\nSometimes I wonder, in any other summer\nCould you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\nAnd RE: Stacks is what the speakers played\nI'd be on tour almost every day\nWhen I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay\nJust watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\nWe used each other's air just for the people to see\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\nWe go anywhere, our minds would take us\nAnd I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up\nAnd you don\u2019t even need to worry about your weight cause\nWe can all be loved the way that God made us\nAnd time's the only reason that we could break up\nCause you would always tell me I'm away too much\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes\nTo get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again\n\n[Hook]\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd every weekend in the winter\nYou'd be wearing my hoodie\nWith drawstrings pulled tight\nTo keep your face from the cold\nTaking day trips to the local\nWhere we'd eat on our own\nCause every day when I was away\nWe'd only speak on the phone\nWatching Blue Planet\nCreating new habits\nActing as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish\nBack to the burrow with all the Celtics\nI disappear, you call me selfish\nI understand but I can\u2019t help it\nI put my job over everything\nExcept my family and friends\nBut you'll be in between forever\nSo I guess we'll have to take a step back\nOverlook the situation\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\nAnd I'm not saying we should be taking a break\nJust re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it\u2019s too late\nSo we can either deal with the pain\nOr wait to get on a plane\nBut in a day we'll have to say it again\n\n[Hook]\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\n\n[Bridge]\nLove will come and love will go\nBut you can't make it on your own\nSing that song, go\nOh won't you leave me now?\nPeople grow and fall apart\nBut you can't mend your broken heart\nTake it back, go\nOh won't you leave me now?\n\n[Hook]\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\n\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?", "[Verse 1]\nTell me that you'll turn down the man\nWho asks for your hand\nCause you're waiting for me\nAnd I know, you're gonna be away a while\nBut I've got no plans at all to leave\nAnd would you take away my hopes and dreams?\nJust stay with me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll my senses come to life\nWhile I'm stumbling home as drunk as I\nHave ever been and I'll never leave again\nCause you are the only one\nAnd all my friends have gone to find\nAnother place to let their hearts collide\nJust promise me, you'll never leave again\nCause you are the only one\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake my hand and my\nHeart and soul, I will\nOnly have these eyes for you\nAnd you know, everything changes but\nWe'll be strangers if we see this through\nYou could stay within these walls and bleed\nOr just stay with me\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAll my senses come to life\nWhile I'm stumbling home as drunk as I\nHave ever been and I'll never leave again\nCause you are the only one\nAnd all my friends have gone to find\nAnother place to let their hearts collide\nJust promise me, you'll always be a friend\nCause you are the only one\n\n[Bridge]\nStumbling half drunk, getting myself lost\nI am so gone, so tell me the way home\nI listen to sad songs, singing about love\nAnd where it goes wrong\n\n[Chorus 2]", "[Verse 1]\nIt's alright to cry\nEven my dad does sometimes\nSo don't wipe your eyes\nTears remind you you're alive\nIt's alright to die\nCause death's the only thing you haven't tried\nBut just for tonight, hold on\n\n[Chorus 1]\nSo live life like you're giving up\nCause you act like you are\nGo ahead and just live it up\nGo on and tear me apart\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's alright to shake\nEven my hand does sometimes\nSo inside we'll rage\nAgainst the dying of the light\nIt's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried\nBut just for today, hold on\n\n[Chorus 2 x2]\nSo live life like you're giving up\nCause you act like you are\nGo ahead and just live it up\nGo on and tear me apart, and hold on", "[Verse 1]\nI should ink my skin with your name\nAnd take my passport out again\nAnd just replace it\nSee I could do without a tan\nOn my left hand\nWhere my fourth finger meets my knuckle\nAnd I should run you a hot bath\nFill it up with bubbles\nCause maybe you're loveable\nMaybe you're my snowflake\nAnd your eyes turn from green to gray\nAnd in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place\nAnd you should never cut your hair\nCause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder\n\n[Hook]\nAnd you will never know\nJust how beautiful you are to me\nBut maybe I'm just in love\nWhen you wake me up\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me\nCould you make me a cup of tea\nTo open my eyes in the right way\nAnd I know you love Shrek\nBecause we've watched it 12 times\nAnd maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too\nAnd if your DVD breaks today\nYou should've got a VCR\nBecause I've never owned a blu-ray, true say\nI know I've always been shit at computer games\nBecause your brother always beats me\nAnd if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV\nAnd then you laugh at me\nAnd be asking me\nIf I'm gonna be home next week\nAnd then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep\nAnd flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I think you hate the smell of smoke\nYou was driving me to stop\nBut you drink as much as me\nAnd I get drunk a lot\nSo I take you to the beach\nAnd walk along the sand\nAnd I'll make you a heart pendant\nWith a pebble held in my hand\nAnd I'll carve it like this necklace\nSo the heart falls where your chest is\nNow a piece of me is a piece of the beach\nAnd it falls just where it needs to be\nAnd rests peacefully\nSo you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now\nAgainst yours now\nMaybe I'm just in love when you wake me up\nMaybe I'm just in love when you wake me up\nMaybe I fell in love when you woke me up", "[Verse 1]\nI'm gonna pick up the pieces\nAnd build a Lego house\nIf things go wrong we can knock it down\nMy three words have two meanings\nThere's one thing on my mind\nIt's all for you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's dark in a cold December\nBut I've got you to keep me warm\nAnd if you're broken I'll mend you\nAnd keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now\n\n[Hook]\nI'm out of touch, I'm out of love\nI'll pick you up when you're getting down\nAnd out of all these things I've done\nI think

numbers\nAnd colour you in\nIf things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall\nAnd it's so hard to say it but I've been here before\nNow I'll surrender up my heart\nAnd swap it for yours\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude]\nDon't hold me down\nI think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook x3]", "[Verse 1]\nGive me love like her\nCause lately I've been

should rise and you should not\nI\u2019ll gently rise and I\u2019ll softly call\nGood nights and joy be with you all\nA man may drink and not be drunk\nA man may fight and not be slain\nA man may court a pretty girl\nAnd perhaps be welcomed back again\nBut since it has so ought to be\nBy a time to rise and a time to fall\nCome fill to me the parting glass\nGood nights and joy be with you

what I wanna do\nWanna runaway, runaway with you\nGonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nHow long you leaving?\nWell, Dad just don\u2019t expect me back this evening\nOh it could

change in a matter of days\nI could be persuaded to hold on\nMama was the same\nNone of us are saints I guess that God knows that\nI don\u2019t wanna runaway\nAnd one of these days I might just show
